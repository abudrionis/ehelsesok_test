0$";participatory continuing design: ""living with"" videoconferencing in rehabilitation;while much research emphasizes design-before-use, we here study design-in-use. the notion of participatory continuing design is introduced to draw attention to the ongoing work of incorporating information and communication technology into work processes in healthcare institutions. through an empirical case study of how telemedicine, in the form of videoconferencing, was taken up in a rehabilitation hospital in norway, the nature of such ongoing experimentation, learning, and redesign is described. when contrasted with traditional design-before-use practices, participatory continuing design differs in terms of its timing, object, process, outcome, and participants. we offer recommendations for how such processes can be supported in healthcare organizations."$0
1$;grid technology: e-learning in telemedicine and organizational collaboration;the present chapter is about telemedicine, but not about software and hardware. it is about humanware. telemedicine's greatest problem is not to make the technology work. it is organizations and humans in organizations who will decide the future of telemedicine. telemedicine is not just a simple success story and the diffusion of telemedicine has been slower than many expected. for the future of telemedicine, a shift in the way we think may be necessary. few authors have focused on learning in telemedicine (with what is here considered as associated aspects: team organization; learning organizations; network organization). the learning potential connected to telemedicine is significant. learning may constitute an important argument for telemedicine. in the present chapter, focus is on the role learning and collaboration may have for the future of telemedicine. to take the full advantage of the learning potential a higher volume of telemedicine is necessary, but this requires more organizational collaboration. improved collaboration is obtainable by implementing collaboration measures. the chapter shows that focus on learning and collaboration may well be important for the future of telemedicine. it is recommended that managers lead change processes in their organizations, where the different aspects of importance for realization of learning benefits of telemedicine are treated. for telemedicine, it is important that future research includes: investigations on how to obtain learning benefits and which collaboration measures are relevant for the different telemedicine applications. objectives of the present chapter are to propose: 1) more international research on learning in telemedicine (with mentioned associated aspects) and telemedicine collaboration problems and 2) to show the background for this proposal. © 2011, igi global.$1
2$;guidelines for reporting of health interventions using mobile phones: mobile health (mhealth) evidence reporting and assessment (mera) checklist;to improve the completeness of reporting of mobile health (mhealth) interventions, the who mhealth technical evidence review group developed the mhealth evidence reporting and assessment (mera) checklist. the development process for mera consisted of convening an expert group to recommend an appropriate approach, convening a global expert review panel for checklist development, and pilot testing the checklist. the guiding principle for the development of these criteria was to identify a minimum set of information needed to defne what the mhealth intervention is (content), where it is being implemented (context), and how it was implemented (technical features), to support replication of the intervention. this paper presents the resulting 16 item checklist and a detailed explanation and elaboration for each item, with illustrative reporting examples. through widespread adoption, we expect that the use of these guidelines will standardise the quality of mhealth evidence reporting, and indirectly improve the quality of mhealth evidence. © bmj publishing group ltd 2016.$0
3$;the reliability of the xmpp protocol extensions as a file transfer mechanism in dedicated healthcare networks;objective: file transfer is a basic service that needs to be provided by a network dedicated to telemedicine and ehealth use. store and forward solutions have so far been based on protocols such as smtp/pop (simple mail transfer protocol/post office protocol), ftp (file transfer protocol) and http (hypertext transfer protocol). however, these are not well suited to the transfer of large files that are associated with healthcare data. to meet the growth in number of institutions connected to the norwegian health network and the amount of network traffic between health institutions within the network, there is a need for better, more reliable and scalable solutions for file transfer. for example the current requirement to support telemedicine applications is transfer of files within the range of 1 to 200 mb for series of ct (computerised tomography) or mri (magnetic resonance imaging) scans. the objective of this study was to investigate the reliability and the potential of the xmpp (extensible messaging and presence protocol) file transfer extensions as the underlying file transfer mechanism for telemedicine solutions in a dedicated healthcare network. methods: we deployed clients and servers for testing purposes in a real health network setting. we tested the xmpp protocol extensions in three different configurations by transferring files with sizes ranging from 1 to 200 mb. we also tested the ftp and smtp/pop protocols to have a realistic basis for comparison. results: the results of our test shows that in the production environment the xmpp protocol extensions configurations have a possible transfer rate ranging from 0.95 mbps to 0.037 mbps depending on the configuration and protocol extensions used. in comparison the ftp transfer rate was 0.8 mbps and for smpt/pop was 0.017 mbps. the configuration with the lowest transfer rate also has the highest potential for transfer error. a favourable feature of xmpp is that files are not stored on a third party server as with current file transfer protocols for ftp and smtp/pop, but only on local area networks. this is perceived as more secure and reduces the costs associated with security maintenance. conclusion: the current file transfer services for store and forward telemedicine is based on use of the smtp/pop protocols which is not suitable for file attachments of the size used in this study. the other alternative, the ftp protocol, has good transfer efficiency but has other drawbacks such as maintainability and the need for server and client configuration. based on the results of our study we conclude that the reliability and efficiency, and the need for configuration and maintenance of the xmpp protocol extensions, indicates that a file transfer service based on these extensions is feasible. © the journal on information technology in healthcare 2009.$1
4$;lessons learnt from a mooc about social media for digital health literacy;nowadays, the internet and social media represent prime channels for health information seeking and peer support. however, benefits of health social media can be reduced by low digital health literacy. we designed a massive open online course (mooc) course about health social media to increase the students' digital health literacy. in this course, we wanted to explore the difficulties confronted by the mooc users in relation to accessing quality online health information and to propose methods to overcome the issues. an online survey was carried out to assess the students' digital health literacy. this survey was one of the activities for the enrolled learners in an online course entitled 'social media in health care' on 'futurelearn', one of the popular mooc platforms. the course was hosted by taipei medical university, taiwan. data from a total of 300 respondents were collected through the online survey from 14 december 2015 to 10 january 2016. most participants (61%) considered finding online health information is easy or very easy, while 39% were unsure or found it difficult to retrieve online health information. most (63%) were not sure about judging whether available information can be used for making health decisions. this study indicates a demand for more training to increase skills to improve the capability of health consumers to identify trustworthy, useful health information. more research to understand the health information seeking process will be crucial in identifying the skillsets that need to be further developed. moocs about digital health can be a great source of knowledge when it comes to studying patients' needs. © 2016 ieee.$0
5$;living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and being followed up through telemedicine - a phenomenological approach;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) provides substantially reduced health related quality of life (hqol). telemonitoring on copd patients appears to have a positive effect on improving hqol. this study has a phenomenological approach, and ten informants, who were followed-up between 1 and 3 months in their own homes through telemonitoring of copd symptoms, narrated their lived experiences of hqol. the results show that the informants experienced safety and increased knowledge through the digital dialog (telemedicine) with expertise nurses, which indirectly improved their hqol, and in term lead to increased mastery and control in managing their disease. several studies show an increased hqol, but the benefits are still limited and there is a need for further research.$1
6$;can economic evaluation in telemedicine be trusted? a systematic review of the literature;background: telemedicine has been advocated as an effective means to provide health care services over a distance. systematic information on costs and consequences has been called for to support decision-making in this field. this paper provides a review of the quality, validity and generalisability of economic evaluations in telemedicine. methods: a systematic literature search in all relevant databases was conducted and forms the basis for addressing these issues. only articles published in peer-reviewed journals and written in english in the period from 1990 to 2007 were analysed. the literature search identified 33 economic evaluations where both costs (resource use) and outcomes (non-resource consequences) were measured. results: this review shows that economic evaluations in telemedicine are highly diverse in terms of both the study context and the methods applied. the articles covered several medical specialities ranging from cardiology and dermatology to psychiatry. the studies analysed telemedicine in home care, and in primary and secondary care settings using a variety of different technologies including videoconferencing, still-images and monitoring (store-and-forward telemedicine). most studies used multiple outcome measures and analysed the effects using disaggregated cost-consequence frameworks. objectives, study design, and choice of comparators were mostly well reported. the majority of the studies lacked information on perspective and costing method, few used general statistics and sensitivity analysis to assess validity, and even fewer used marginal analysis. conclusion: as this paper demonstrates, the majority of the economic evaluations reviewed were not in accordance with standard evaluation techniques. further research is needed to explore the reasons for this and to address how economic evaluation in telemedicine best can take advantage of local constraints and at the same time produce valid and generalisable results.$1
7$";sufficient competence in community elderly care? results from a competence measurement of nursing staff;background: multi-morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment leave many old patients in a frail condition with a high risk of adverse outcomes if proper health care is not provided. knowledge about available competence is necessary to evaluate whether we are able to offer equitable and balanced health care to older persons with acute and/or complex health care needs. this study investigates the sufficiency of nursing staff competence in norwegian community elderly care. methods: we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1016 nursing staff in nursing homes and home care services with the instrument ""nursing older people - competence evaluation tool"". statistical analyses were anova and multiple regression. results: we found that nursing staff have competence in all areas measured, but that the level of competence was insufficient in the areas nursing measures, advanced procedures, and nursing documentation. nursing staff in nursing homes scored higher than staff in home care services, and older nursing staff scored lower than younger nursing staff. conclusions: a reason for the relatively low influence of education and training on competence could be the diffuse roles that nursing staff have in community elderly care, implying that they have poor standards against which to judge their own competence. clearer role descriptions for all groups of nursing staff are recommended as well as general competence development in geriatric nursing care. © 2016 bing-jonsson et al."$0
8$;competence complexity and obvious learning experience from developing a language learning game;a computer role-playing game for language learning was created in a european project. the process was challenging with a multidisciplinary team from three countries who did not know each other well before the project started. game designers, linguists, pedagogues and teachers have different approaches to how such an educational tool should function. the requirements for the game were scarce before the project started, so it was up to the team to agree on the game design and contents. we early realised that we had to work much more closely together than what is common in educational projects, so we used virtual meeting rooms extensively in addition to many physical meetings. one important conclusion regarding the process is that small prototypes should have been made very early to enhance the understanding and cooperation between the writers and designers and those responsible for the pedagogical contents. designers and pedagogical personnel should also have had a much closer cooperation in the early phases to better integrate the learning material into the game story. this paper discusses how we worked together to get consensus about the game. we will also touch upon some of the technical difficulties we had trying to satisfy all our requirements with the chosen open source platforms. we also say a few words about the first reactions of the target group. the focus is however on the process of making educational games and what can be learnt from this experience.$0
9$;exploring the role of informants in interpretive case study research in is;interpretive case study research constitutes an important and increasing part of the information systems (is) knowledge base (walsham, 1993; myers, 1997; paré and elam, 1997; walsham, 2006). interpretive case studies can be distinguished from positivist case study research (benbasat et al., 1987; lee, 1989; dubé and paré, 2003) by the focus on close interaction between researcher and participants throughout the case study process, viewing the case members as active participants in the construction of the case narrative (boland, 1985; guba and lincoln, 1989; kvale, 2002). however, while the interpretivist perspective ascribes an active role to the case study informants, in practice the extent of this involvement is normally confined to the data collection process and discussion of early versions of the case narrative. in few cases is the involvement of the informants reported to continue further to the final stages of analytical abstraction of the case study data, where the aim is to develop the overall patterns and explanations. © association for information technology trust 2016.$0
10$;is our fascination with museum displays more about what we think or how we feel?;what is the cognitive and emotional nature of fascination? drawing on theories of cognitive and emotional interest, we explored the nature of visitor fascination (i.e., intense interest) at two high north museums in norway. in study 1, we found interesting and informative patterns related to which museum displays 20 teenage visitors experienced as particularly fascinating and why, along with the cognitive and affective qualities associated with those fascinations. we pursued these findings in more detail with 60 new visitors in study 2. through path modeling we were then able to capture the dynamics of when each of the following variables mattered to museum display experiences and in what ways: (1) display-relevant prior knowledge and interest, (2) the cognitive accessibility and emotional pleasure of museum display experiences, and (3) cognitive and affective interest outcomes. implications for theories of interest and future research for exhibit design are discussed. © visitor studies association.$0
11$";infrastructural arrangements for integrated care: implementing an electronic nursing plan in a psychogeriatric ward;purpose: the paper contributes to the conceptualisation of ""integrated care"" in heterogeneous work practices. a dynamic perspective is developed, emphasising how integrated care is malleable, open, and achieved in practice. furthermore, we explore the role of nursing plans in integrated care practices, underscoring the inherent difficulties of building one common infrastructural system for integrated care. methods: empirically, we studied the implementation of an electronic nursing plan in a psychiatric ward at the university hospital of north norway. we conducted 80 hours of participant observation and 15 interviews. results: while the nursing plan was successful as a formal tool among the nurses, it was of limited use in practice where integrated care was carried out. in some instances, the use of the nursing plan even undermined integrated care. conclusion: integrated care is not a constant entity, but is much more situated and temporal in character. a new infrastructural system for integrated care should not be envisioned as replacing most of the existing information sources, but rather seen as an extension to the heterogeneous ensemble of existing ones."$1
12$;the experiences of using a computerized decision support system;the aim was to describe the facilitators and barriers influencing the ability of nursing personnel to effectively use a cdss for planning and treating pressure ulcers and malnutrition in nursing homes. usability evaluations and group interviews were conducted. facilitators were ease of use, usefulness and a supportive work environment. lack of training, resistance to using computers and limited integration of the cdss with the electronic health record system were reported.$1
13$";is there a weekly pattern for health searches on wikipedia and is the pattern unique to health topics?;background: online health information-seeking behaviors have been reported to be more common at the beginning of the workweek. this behavior pattern has been interpreted as a kind of ""healthy new start"" or ""fresh start"" due to regrets or attempts to compensate for unhealthy behavior or poor choices made during the weekend. however, the observations regarding the most common health information-seeking day were based only on the analyses of users' behaviors with websites on health or on online health-related searches. we wanted to confirm if this pattern could be found in searches of wikipedia on health-related topics and also if this search pattern was unique to health-related topics or if it could represent a more general pattern of online information searching-which could be of relevance even beyond the health sector. objective: the aim was to examine the degree to which the search pattern described previously was specific to health-related information seeking or whether similar patterns could be found in other types of information-seeking behavior. methods: we extracted the number of searches performed on wikipedia in the norwegian language for 911 days for the most common sexually transmitted diseases (chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, human immunodeficiency virus [hiv], and acquired immune deficiency syndrome [aids]), other health-related topics (influenza, diabetes, and menopause), and 2 nonhealth-related topics (footballer lionel messi and pop singer justin bieber). the search dates were classified according to the day of the week and anova tests were used to compare the average number of hits per day of the week. results: the anova tests showed that the sexually transmitted disease queries had their highest peaks on tuesdays (p<.001) and the fewest searches on saturdays. the other health topics also showed a weekly pattern, with the highest peaks early in the week and lower numbers on saturdays (p<.001). footballer lionel messi had the highest mean number of hits on tuesdays and wednesdays, whereas pop singer justin bieber had the most hits on tuesdays. both these tracked search queries also showed significantly lower numbers on saturdays (p<.001). conclusions: our study supports prior studies finding an increase in health information searching at the beginning of the workweek. however, we also found a similar pattern for 2 randomly chosen nonhealth-related terms, which may suggest that the search pattern is not unique to health-related searches. the results are potentially relevant beyond the field of health and our preliminary findings need to be further explored in future studies involving a broader range of nonhealth-related searches."$0
14$;weekly pattern for online information seeking on hiv - a multi-language study;studies have demonstrated that there are weekly patterns of information-seeking activities on sexual health topics in some selected languages. however, it is not known if this weekly pattern is found across the ten most commonly-used languages on the internet, and whether international public events might have an impact on these information-seeking patterns. the objective of this study is to examine sexual health information-seeking patterns for searches performed in several languages, and also to analyze the potential impact of public events on these information-seeking rates. we extracted the number of hits on the hiv article on wikipedia for the ten most used languages on the internet for all of the year 2015. the results confirm the existence of a weekly pattern for the searches performed in english, spanish, portuguese, japanese, russian, french, and german. but the weekly pattern was not found for searches in mandarin chinese, arabic, and malay. the number of hiv queries increased significantly during two public events, the world aids day, and the announcement regarding the hiv-positive condition of the celebrity actor charlie sheen. the existence of higher peaks in searching rates at the beginning of the week for some languages, and the increase in queries related to public events could represent valuable opportunities for public campaigns promoting sexual health.$0
15$";service users' perspectives in the design of an online tool for assisted self-help in mental health: a case study of implications;background: the involvement of persons with lived experiences of mental illness and service use is increasingly viewed as key to improving the relevance and utility of mental health research and service innovation. guided by the principles of community-based participatory research we developed an online tool for assisted self-help in mental health. the resulting tool, psyconnect, is ready for testing in two communities starting 2014. this case study reports from the design phase which entailed clarifying very basic questions: who is the primary target group? what are the aims? what functions are priorities? roles and responsibilities? what types of evidence can legitimize tool design decisions? here we highlight the views of service users as a basis for discussing implications of user involvement for service design and research. case description: psyconnect has become a tool for those who expect to need assistance over long periods of time regardless of their specific condition(s). the aim is to support service users in gaining greater overview and control, legitimacy, and sense of continuity in relationships. it has a personalized ""my control panel"" which depicts status --> process --> goals. functionality includes support for: mapping life domains; medication overview; crisis management; coping exercises; secure messaging; and social support. while the types of evidence that can legitimize design decisions are scattered and indirectly relevant, recent trends in recovery research will be used to guide further refinements. discussion: psyconnect has undoubtedly become something other than it would have been without careful attention to the views of service users. the tool invites a proactive approach that is likely to challenge treatment cultures that are reactive, disorder-focused and consultation-based. service user representatives will need to play central roles in training peers and clinicians in order to increase the likelihood of tool usage in line with intentions. similarly, their influence on tool design has implications for choice of methods for evaluation. conclusions: starting down the path of service user involvement in intervention design fosters commitment to follow through in the remaining implementation and research phases. while this can be time-consuming and less meriting for researchers, it is probably vital to increasing the likelihood of success of person-centered service innovations."$1
16$;software developers in india and norway: professional or national cultures?;in this paper, the authors investigate the professional practices of software developers from two different cultures-norway and india. the authors examine if systematic differences exist between norwegian and indian software developers in their professional practice. using hofstede's cultural dimensions, the authors expected to find cultural differences between the two groups of professionals. building on a survey among software developers in the two countries, the authors have the following conclusions. firstly, the main finding is that there are surprisingly few differences between the two groups, giving support to the view of a common professional culture. secondly, the few differences that are observed cannot easily be explained by hofstede's cultural dimensions. © 2013 by igi global. all rights reserved.$0
17$;automatic configuration of mobile applications using context-aware cloud-based services;the area of information technology continues to experience considerable progress and innovation in recent years. computers have evolved from large and very expensive devices, to mainstream products we take for granted in our everyday lives. increasingly, cloud-based services have come to the fore. additionally, many people own multiple computing devices, from normal desktop computers to small mobile devices. we find mobile computing devices of particularly interest and this will be the focus of our study. in this chapter, we investigate a context-aware and cloud-based adaptation of mobile devices and user's experience. our research displays new and novel contribution to the area of context-awareness in the cloud setup. we propose and demonstrated principles in implemented applications, whereby context-aware information is harvested from several dimensions to build a rich foundation for context-aware computation. furthermore, we have exploited and combined this with the area of cloud computing technology to create a new user experience and a new way to invoke control over user's mobile phone. through a developed application suite with the following evaluation, we have shown the feasibility of such an approach. moreover, we believe our research, incorporating remote, and automatically configuration of android phone advances the research area of context-aware information. © 2015 springer international publishing switzerland.$0
18$;to bend or not to bend? rule adherence among staff at an eating disorder unit;on inpatient eating disorder units, resolving under-nutrition and reestablishing normal eating behavior are key treatment aims. consequently, the provision of support at mealtimes is a core work task for patients with severe eating disorders. the purpose of this study was to explore staff deliberations and actions, as observed during staff-patient interactions at mealtimes on an inpatient eating disorder unit (edu). we specifically aimed to characterize how and why staff members intervene during staff-patient interactions in which a refeeding script is activated. this exploratory qualitative study combined non-participant observation and in-depth interviews. content analysis was used to categorize and abstract the data material. through the described analysis, we identified two main types of patterns which were categorized as rule adherence and rule bending, describing how staff chose how to intervene in situations where refeeding scripts were activated. the current findings may contribute to enhanced insight and awareness regarding staff behavior and deliberations when providing meal support, and thus help staff members to better understand how meal time support is practiced on inpatient edus.$0
19$;un/doing gender with ict?;what might new information and communication technologies (icts) at work do for gender? this question is explored here through an empirical study that traces the introduction of one ict application-an electronic patient record (epr)-into nursing and medical work in a university hospital in norway. health care work is well documented as a highly gendered field, where normalizing gender practices have dominated. the aim of this article is to explore emergent configurations of gender, ict, and health care work following the introduction of the epr. drawing on judith butler's conceptualization of performativity, where gender is produced only as it is cited in everyday practice, we pay attention to both the normative and the disruptive moments of these configurations. in order to understand gender in modern health care we suggest an analysis of the performative co-constitution of gender, technology, and work as it is done on a daily basis at the hospital. we explore the gender effects of this co-constitution, also as gender norms are challenged and new ways of performing professional identities in health care are moved beyond the familiar categories of the past. © 2010 taylor & francis.$0
20$;experiences of nursing personnel using pdas in home health care services in norwegian municipalities;although nursing personnel have used personal digital assistants (pdas) to support home health care services for the past ten years, little is known about their experiences. this study was conducted to examine experiences of nursing personnel using a specialized home health care computer software application called gerica. in addition, this research analyzed how well this application aligned with the workflow of the nursing personnel in their daily care of patients. the evaluation methods included user observations and learnability testing. nursing personnel from two different municipalities were observed while performing real tasks in natural settings. this study shows that the nursing personnel were satisfied with the pda user interface and the gerica software; however, they identified areas for improvement. for example, the nursing personnel were concerned about trusting the reliability of the pda in order to eliminate the need for handwritten documentation. solutions to meet these shortcomings for nursing managers and vendors are discussed.$1
21$;complexity and risk;as said in the introduction, an important motivation for the research presented in this book is ulrich beck's development of the theory of the (world) risk society and the research that this theory has inspired or at least influenced heavily. accordingly, this theory, and its more mature and general version, the theory of reflexive modernization, will be presented in the first section of this chapter. in parallel with the development of these theories, the 'complexity science' field has emerged. as this book focuses on risks related to complexity, an overview of this field will also be given. in the following sections we will inquire deeper into the relations between these theories, arguing that they have a common core. © ole hanseth and claudio ciborra, 2007. all rights reserved.$0
22$;from systems and tools to networks and infrastructures-from design to cultivation: towards a design theory of information infrastructures;the author argues in this chapter that the kind of it solutions we are developing today and in the years to come, which are integrating numbers of systems across organizational and geographical borders, in many respects are significantly different from and more complex than information systems of yesterday. to succeed with the establishment of such solutions new understandings and development approaches are needed. such new understandings, and approaches should be based on a perspective seeing such solutions as information infrastructures-not information systems. infrastructures evolve over long periods of time. new ones are designed as extensions and improvements of existing ones-not from scratch. therefore the new elements have to fit into the old regime. in this process the existing infrastructure, the installed base, influences heavily how the new elements can be designed. as the installed base grows its development and further growth become self-reinforcing. successful development of infrastructures requires, first, the creation of such a self-reinforcing process, second, managing its direction. strategies for creating and managing such processes are here called cultivation. gateways are important tools used in such cultivation processes. © 2010, igi global.$0

24$;infrastructural innovation and generative information infrastructures;this chapter addresses issues related to how to enable the broadest possible innovative activities by infrastructural technology design. the authors focus on the development of high-level services based on mobile telecommunication technologies that for matters of simplicity are termed the development of a mobile internet. the focus of the analysis is how features of the technology itself enable or constrain innovations. the authors do this by looking on a few embryos of the mobile internet (primarily the norwegian cpa platform, but also two pre-cpa platforms in norway and japan's i-mode) through the concepts of end-to-end architecture, programmability of terminals, and generativity. this analysis illustrates that the change from closed infrastructures like mobilinfo and smsinfo to more open ones like cpa and i-mode increased the speed and range of innovation substantially. at the same time, the differences between cpa and i-mode regarding programmability of terminals and the billing service provided by the cpa network enabling the billing of individual transactions also contributed to basically the same speed and range of innovations around cpa as i-mode in spite of the huge differences in investments into the networks made by the owners. however, the analysis also points out important differences between the internet and the existing mobile internet regarding technological constraints on innovations. it points out important ways in which powerful actors' strategies inhibit innovations, and how they embed their strategies into the technology and, accordingly, create technological barriers for innovation. © 2015, igi global.$0
25$;standardization work on personalized ehealth systems;for widespread adoption of ehealth, and to achieve elnclusion and eaccessibility, ehealth systems must be tailored to each individual user's needs and preferences. many ehealth products and services contain adjustable parameter settings, but they are specific to each product and unrelated to each other. this paper describes ongoing work to establish standards and guidelines for personalization of ehealth systems, taking into account the needs of all users, both clients and caregivers. the standard builds on a generic 'user profile', which stores data about the users, their preferences and their context. this profile can then be used by ehealth services and devices to ensure a user experience tailored to each person. the work surveys relevant areas of personalization, like identity management, profile management etc, addressing in depth those aspects of personalization that are specific to ehealth: user capabilities, care provider roles and functions, health related information, and confidentiality measures. ©2008 ieee.$1

27$;analysis of free text in electronic health records for identification of cancer patient trajectories;with an aging patient population and increasing complexity in patient disease trajectories, physicians are often met with complex patient histories from which clinical decisions must be made. due to the increasing rate of adverse events and hospitals facing financial penalties for readmission, there has never been a greater need to enforce evidence-led medical decision-making using available health care data. in the present work, we studied a cohort of 7,741 patients, of whom 4,080 were diagnosed with cancer, surgically treated at a university hospital in the years 2004-2012. we have developed a methodology that allows disease trajectories of the cancer patients to be estimated from free text in electronic health records (ehrs). by using these disease trajectories, we predict 80% of patient events ahead in time. by control of confounders from 8326 quantified events, we identified 557 events that constitute high subsequent risks (risk > 20%), including six events for cancer and seven events for metastasis. we believe that the presented methodology and findings could be used to improve clinical decision support and personalize trajectories, thereby decreasing adverse events and optimizing cancer treatment.$1
28$;firepatch: secure and time-critical dissemination of software patches;because software security patches contain information about vulnerabilities, they can be reverse engineered into exploits. tools for doing this already exist. as a result, there is a race between hackers and end-users to obtain patches first. in this paper we present and evaluate firepatch, an intrusion-tolerant dissemination mechanism that combines encryption, replication, and sandboxing such that end-users are able to win the security patch race.$0
29$;connecting with ourselves and others online: psychological aspects of online health communication;in this chapter, we look at some fundamental aspects of communicating about ourselves and our health through technology. in particular, we examine how the social psychological theories of self-presentation and self-regulation might be applied to online health-communication. it is argued that the specific qualities of text-based communication might have unique benefits for health-communication through the interplay between the writing process and the concerns posed by health-issues. an understanding of how psychological processes are connected with online health communication is believed to be fundamental in understanding trends within self-help and user-driven health communication, and to predict possible outcomes of such behavior. also, this knowledge might inform the design and development of patient-centered solutions for health-communication and heath-service delivery. © 2009, igi global.$0
30$;helping patients in performing online video search: evaluating the importance of medical terminology extracted from mesh and icd-10 in health video title and description;huge amounts of health-related videos are available on the internet, and health consumers are increasingly searching for answers to their health problems and health concerns by availing themselves of web-based video sources. however, a critical factor in identifying relevant videos based on a textual query is the accuracy of the metadata with respect to video content. this chapter focuses on how reputable health videos providers, such as hospitals and health organizations, describe diabetes-related video content and the frequency with which they use standard terminology found in medical thesauri. in this study, we compared video title and description to medical terms extracted from the mesh and icd-10 vocabularies, respectively. we found that only a small number of videos were described using medical terms (4% of the videos included an exact icd-10 term; and 7% an exact mesh term). furthermore, of all those videos that used medical terms in their title/description, we found an astonishingly low variety of diabetes-related medical terms used. for example, the video titles and descriptions brought up only 2.4% of the icd-10 terms and 4.3% of mesh terms, respectively. these figures give one pause to think as to how many useful health videos are haplessly eluding online patient search because of the sparse use of appropriate terms in titles and descriptions. thus, no one would deny that including medical terms in video title and description is useful to patients who are searching for relevant health information. adopting good practices for titling and describing health-related videos may similarly help producers of youtube videos to identify and address the gaps in the delivery of informational resources that patients need to be able to monitor their own health. sadly, as the situation is now, neither patients nor producers of health videos are able to explore the collection of online materials in the same systematic manner as the medical professional explores medical domains using medline. why can we not have the same level of rigorous and systematic curating of patient-related health videos as we have for other medical content on the web?. © 2014 walter de gruyter inc., boston/berlin. all rights reserved.$1
31$;nurse leadership and informatics competencies: shaping transformation of professional practice;nurse leaders must demonstrate capacities and develop specific informatics competencies in order to provide meaningful leadership and support ongoing transformation of the healthcare system. concurrently, staff informatics competencies must be planned and fostered to support critical principles of transformation and patient safety in practice, advance evidence-informed practice, and enable nursing to flourish in complex digital environments across the healthcare continuum. in addition to nurse leader competencies, two key aspects of leadership and informatics competencies will be addressed in this chapter - namely, the transformation of health care and preparation of the nursing workforce.$0
32$;online social exergames for seniors: a pillar of gamification for clinical practice;the population is getting older, and the resources for care will be even more limited in the future than they are now. there is thus an aim for the society that the seniors can manage themselves as long as possible, while at the same time keeping a high quality of life. physical activity is important to stay fit, and social contact is important for the quality of life. the aim of this chapter is to provide a state-ofthe- art of online social exergames for seniors, providing glimpses of senior users' opinions and games limitations. the importance of the motivational techniques is emphasized, as well as the impact that the exergames have to seniors. it contributes to the book objectives focusing on current state and practice in health games for physical training and rehabilitation and the use of gamification, exploring future opportunities and uses of gamification in ehealth and discussing the respective challenges and limitations. © 2016 by igi global. all rights reserved.$1
33$";controversial ebola vaccine trials in ghana: a thematic analysis of critiques and rebuttals in digital news;background: communication is of paramount importance in responding to health crises. we studied the media messages put forth by different stakeholders in two ebola vaccine trials that became controversial in ghana. these interactions between health authorities, political actors, and public citizens can offer key lessons for future research. through an analysis of online media, we analyse stakeholder concerns and incentives, and the phases of the dispute, to understand how the dispute evolved to the point of the trials being suspended, and analyse what steps might have been taken to avert this outcome. methods: a web-based system was developed to download and analyse news reports relevant to ebola vaccine trials. this included monitoring major online newspapers in each country with planned clinical trials, including ghana. all news articles were downloaded, selecting out those containing variants of the words ""ebola,"" and ""vaccine,"" which were analysed thematically by a team of three coders. two types of themes were defined: critiques of the trials and rebuttals in favour of the trials. after reconciling differences between coders' results, the data were visualised and reviewed to describe and interpret the debate. results: a total of 27,460 articles, published between 1 may and 30 july 2015, were collected from nine different newspapers in ghana, of which 139 articles contained the keywords and met the inclusion criteria. the final codebook included 27 themes, comprising 16 critiques and 11 rebuttals. after coding and reconciliation, the main critiques (and their associated rebuttals) were selected for in-depth analysis, including statements about the trials being secret (mentioned in 21% of articles), claims that the vaccine trials would cause an ebola outbreak in ghana (33%), and the alleged impropriety of the incentives offered to participants (35%). discussion: perceptions that the trials were ""secret"" arose from a combination of premature news reporting and the fact that the trials were prohibited from conducting any publicity before being approved at the time that the story came out, which created an impression of secrecy. fears about ebola being spread in ghana appeared in two forms, the first alleging that scientists would intentionally infect ghanaians with ebola in order to test the vaccine, and the second suggesting that the vaccine might give trial participants ebola as a side-effect - over the course of the debate, the latter became the more prominent of the two variants. the incentives were sometimes criticised for being coercively large, but were much more often criticised for being too small, which may have been related to a misperception that the incentives were meant as compensation for the trials' risks, which were themselves exaggerated. conclusion: the rumours captured through this research indicate the variety of strong emotions drawn out by the trials, highlighting the importance of understanding the emotional and social context of such research. the uncertainty, fear, and distrust associated with the trials draw from the contemporary context of the ebola outbreak, as well as longstanding historical issues in ghana. by analysing the debate from its inception, we can see how the controversy unfolded, and identify points of concern that can inform health communication, suggesting that this tool may be valuable in future epidemics and crises. © 2017 the author(s)."$0
34$;health information accessed on the internet: the development in 5 european countries;the aim of this study was to summarize and analyse findings from four prior studies on the use of the internet as a source of health information in five european countries (norway, denmark, germany, greece, and portugal). a cross-study comparison of data was performed. all the studies included fit with a trend of a sharp and continuous growth in the use of the internet for health information access in the major part of the last decade. importantly, the internet has become an important mass media source of health information in northern europe. while the use of the internet for health information is somewhat less common in the south european countries, its use is also clearly increasing there. we discuss the advantages of cross-study comparisons of data and methodological challenges. as the use of the internet for health information is likely to peak in some countries in the near future, new population surveys on health information access should focus more on the details of information that is accessed and which sites that are most used and trusted.$0
35$;ehealth services for enhanced pharmaceutical care provision: from counseling to patient education;epharmacare project aims at assessing the potential of ehealth services in the provision of cognitive pharmaceutical services by interacting actively with patients. there is the awareness that patient education will be vital. collection of data on pharmaceutical services and diagnosis of the use of it in pharmacy settings was made with the application of a survey. a set of pharmacies was selected to study the pattern of services' provision supported by observational studies to evaluate the economic and clinical value of services to patients. the results will allow a better understanding of pharmaceutical services' delivery and a new perspective for pharmaceutical services integration with the health system. due to the shortage of physicians, the development of a new internet based pharmaceutical service with educational components could be an important contribution to an effective chronic diseases' management and to change the role of patients. furthermore there is the necessity of rethinking the community pharmacy business model to effectively integrate within future health systems. © 2013 ieee.$1
36$;the construction of a subset of icnp(r) for patients with dementia: a delphi consensus and a group interview study;background: the international classification for nursing practice (icnp(r)) 2013 includes over 4000 concepts for global nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions and is a large and complex set of standardised nursing concepts and expressions. nurses may use subsets from the icnp as concepts and expressions for research, education and clinical practice. the objective of this study was to identify and validate concepts for an icnp subset to guide observations and documentation of nursing care for patients with dementia. method: the process model for developing icnp subsets was followed, according to the guidelines adopted by the international council of nursing (icn). to identify relevant and useful concepts for the subset, a modified form of the delphi method was used. six nurses working in healthcare services in three municipalities in norway with postgraduate education in geriatric psychiatry and dementia care participated in two delphi sessions. the participants reviewed and scored the concepts included in the suggested subset and had an opportunity to rewrite them and offer alternatives. to validate the subset after the delphi study, a group interview was conducted with six other nurses with postgraduate education in geriatric psychiatry and dementia care. the group interview was recorded and transcribed, and summative content analysis was used. results: suitable concepts for an icnp subset to guide observations and documentation of nursing care for patients with dementia were identified. in total, 301 concepts were identified, including 77 nursing diagnoses, 78 outcomes and 146 nursing interventions. an increased focus on concepts to describe basic psychosocial needs such as identity, comfort, connection, inclusion and engagement was recommended by nurses in the validation process. conclusions: relevant and pre-formulated nursing diagnoses, goals and interventions were identified, which can be used to develop care plans and facilitate accuracy in the documentation of individuals with dementia. the participants believed that it may be difficult to find formulations for all steps of the nursing process. in particular, nursing diagnoses and psychosocial needs are often inadequately documented. the participants highlighted the need for the subset to contain essential information about psychosocial needs and communication.$1
37$;data management in an intelligent environment for cognitive disabled and elderly people;recently intelligent and personalized medical systems tend to be one of the most important branches of the health-care domain, playing a great role in improving the quality of life of people that want to feel safe and to be assisted not regarding the place they are. this paper presents an innovative way of data management based on a middleware platform providing services for fast and easy creation of applications dealing with the problems of taking care of patients in their homes. the work was carried out as a part of the mpower project, funded by the eu 6(th) framework programme, and carried out by a multinational development team. the project focuses on supporting activities of daily living and provides services for elderly and cognitive disabled, e.g. people with dementia. the mpower platform is designed to facilitate rapid development of a variety of applications and adopt them to specific users' needs. the paper introduces the whole platform, its functionality and principal goals along with the architectural background of data management, focusing on the different types of data that the system has to manage and analyze. the last section concludes the work done on the project.$1
38$;carersupport - an innovative approach to informal carers' training and collaboration;eu and national policies for long-term care acknowledge the role of informal carers. however, there is still little adequate support to prepare or ease informal carers in terms of training to allow them improve their skills, alleviate psychosocial stress and maintain their own health and well-being. in the carersupport project, we seek to integrate services, deploy and test an integrated ict platform enabling participation and collaboration of informal carers, psychologists and health professionals to collaborate, facilitate training and orientation, offer tele-consulting services and psychosocial support to carers. based on this platform and its content, we will deploy and report on informal carers' experiences with the wide range of offered service. the poster will present the first experiences and suggest potentials for a service like carersupport.$1
39$;supporting operating nurses' collaborative work: preventing information overload and tailoring information access;collaboration and coordination are demanding tasks in health care, but may be supported by computer systems. in this paper we describe our initial work in a large research project (cooperation support through transparency). the aim is to provide actors with information about the course of a process, thereby facilitating informed decisions and in such way support collaboration in pen-operative processes. the focus in this paper is on operating nurses' current use of information resources and their information needs. we use a combination of semi-structured interviews and participant observation. theoretically, our analyses are informed by e.g. the concepts awareness and articulation work. the study shows that this combination of methods is most useful, offering complementary insights and drawing an attention to mismatches between what is said and what is done by nurses. furthermore, based on the empirical material, we discuss implications for design.$1
40$;usability of composing rest services on smartphones;rest service are generally more appropriate for smartphones than its counterpart, soap. however, the flexibility, scalability and performance gained through rest services are never enough to meet the goal of addressing the complex and mobile relationships among people. that is, usability of the rest service must be enhanced for involving none-programmers to compose services on their smartphones thereby address the complex and mobile relationships among people. in this paper, we explored the factors influencing usability of the rest web service on the smartphone environment. accordingly, the breadth and depth of uris namespace, number of request parameters and response fields, and the naming of uris, parameters and response fields are found to be the factors that influence the usability of composing rest services on smartphones. © 2017 ieee.$0
41$;how does nursing staff perceive the use of electronic handover reports? a questionnaire-based study;following the implementation of electronic nursing records in a psychogeriatric ward, we examined nursing staff's attitudes and perceptions to the implementation of an electronic handover routine. a web-based anonymous and secure questionnaire was distributed by e-mail to all nursing staff at a psychogeriatric ward at a university hospital. most respondents were satisfied with the electronic handover, and they believed they managed to keep informed by the new routine. the simultaneous introduction of a morning meeting, to ensure a forum for oral professional discussion, was a success. a minority of staff did not fully trust the information conveyed in the electronic handover, and a significant proportion expressed a need for guidance in using the system. staff that had a high level of trust in written reports believed these saved time, had little trouble finding time and a place to read the reports, and were more positive to the new handover routine.$1
42$;personal health information management;the payoffs for personal information management (pim) may be especially large in targeted domains such as health care. the health care we can acquire and receive is increasingly sophisticated and complex. treatments and care are offered at multiple sites, ranging from highly specialized hospitals, outpatient clinics, community hospitals, doctor's offices, physical therapy clinics, and nursing homes to the home dwelling. therefore, health care has developed into a complex, and too often fragmented, set of episodes of care. more and more, healthcare recipients and their families are invited, even expected, to engage in the complex activities of coordinating and integrating their health care and their health-care information. © 2007 university of washington press. all rights reserved.$1
43$;telemedicine and e-learning in a primary care setting in sudan: the experience of the gezira family medicine project;information and communication technology (ict) is progressively used in the health sector (e-health), to provide health care in a distance (telemedicine), facilitate medical education (e-learning), and manage patients' information (electronic medical records, emrs). gezira family medicine project (gfmp) in sudan provides a 2-year master's degree in family medicine, with ict fully integrated in the project. this cross-sectional study describes ict implementation and utilization at the gfmp for the years 2011-2012. administrative data was used to describe ict implementation, while questionnaire-based data was used to assess candidates' perceptions and satisfaction. in the period from april 2011 to december 2012, 3808 telemedicine online consultations were recorded and over 165000 new patients' emrs were established by the study subjects (125 candidates enrolled in the program). almost all respondents confirmed the importance of telemedicine. the majority appreciated also the importance of using emrs. online lectures were highly rated by candidates in spite of the few challenges encountered by combining service provision with learning activity. physicians highlighted some patients' concerns about the use of telemedicine and emrs during clinical consultations. results from this study confirmed the suitability of ict use in postgraduate training in family medicine and in service provision.$1
44$;citizens' access to their digital health data in eleven countries - a comparative study;governments around the world are actively promoting citizens electronic access to their health data as one of a number of ways to respond to the challenges of health care delivery in the 21st century. while numerous approaches have been utilized it is evident from cross-country comparisons that there are different conceptualizations of: both the expected and desired roles for citizens in the management of their own health; the benefits that will be delivered by citizen access and how these benefits should be measured and benchmarked over-time. this paper presents comparative analyses of the methods by which citizens are provided with access to their own health data across 11 countries. the paper aims to stimulate debate on electronic citizen access to health data and the challenges of measuring benefit as well as reflection on capacity of different citizens to engage with e-health.$1
45$;biometric recognition of surgically altered periocular region: a comprehensive study;wide acceptance of biometrics as an authentication mode has led to investigation of multiple modalities such as face, periocular, iris for the long term robustness. due to various deformities arising out of deteriorating health, need for enhancing the beauty by choice or to fix the injury as a result of trauma or aging, people tend to undergo surgery. however, such surgeries do not guarantee the restoration of physical biometric characteristics (face, periocular, iris etc.) to original appearance and thereby impacting the performance in biometric identifications. among many physical biometric characteristics, periocular recognition is widely accepted for authentication purposes. this work studies the impact of periocular surgeries on biometric performance. to this extent, we introduce a new large scale periocular surgery database comprising of 402 unique periocular images acquired before and after the surgery. this is the first work that provides comprehensive study on evaluating the impact of surgeries in periocular region on periocular recognition. extensive experiments are carried out on a newly created dataset using 11 different state-of-art periocular recognition schemes. further, we also explore score level fusion of these algorithms. results obtained on the newly created large scale database indicate the degraded identification performance of both the state-of-art and fusion algorithms. © 2016 ieee.$0
46$;fosbas: a bi-directional secrecy and collusion resilience key management scheme for bans;body area network (ban) consists of various types of small physiological sensors, transmission modules and low computational components and can thus form an e-health solution for continuous all-day and any-place health monitoring. to protect confidentiality of collected data, a shared group key is usually deployed in a ban, and consequently a secure communication group is generated. in this paper, we propose a bi-directional security and collusion resilience key management scheme for ban, referred to as fosbas. detailed analysis shows that the scheme can provide both forward security and backward security and resist against collusion attacks. furthermore, the fosbas is implemented on a sun spot based sensor network testbed to evaluate its performance. experimental results show that a group key can be updated within 102.13 ms with 60.22 mj energy consumption on a 12 node ban with 28 bits pairwise key. © 2012 ieee.$0
47$;future internet enabled ship-port coordination;this paper presents a future internet based concept for integrated planning of port call, meaning the coordination of resource planning among all actors involved: port, terminal, ship, agents, and other stakeholders. in the project finest, ict tools based on software-as-a-service principles were sketched and a scenario-based demonstrator was built in order to showcase the possibilities offered by future internet technologies. data from the port of aalesund were used to illustrate how the planning challenge at port and terminal can be tackled by getting the right information at the right time, from and to the right actor. the business model supported by the finest platform is the semi-automatic handling of port call based on real-time information enabled by synchronization of resource planning among the port and terminal service suppliers. the ship can register its port call and book services through a platform displaying real-time information about resource availabilities, while the port-and terminal service providers can coordinate their services and resources also based on real-time information provided by the platform. the main expected benefit is the coordination of information among multiple actors, enabling more visibility, more efficient planning of services at port and terminals, easier booking of services, better capacity utilization, as well as support for optimization of ship voyage.$0
48$;low-intensity self-management intervention for persons with type 2 diabetes using a mobile phone-based diabetes diary, with and without health counseling and motivational interviewing: protocol for a randomized controlled trial;background: the present study protocol is designed to cover the norwegian part of the european union collaborative project-regions of europe working together for health (renewing health). self-management support is an important element of care for persons with type 2 diabetes (t2d) for achieving metabolic control and positive lifestyle changes. telemedicine (tm) with or without health counseling may become an important technological aid for self-management and may provide a user-centered model of care. in spite of many earlier studies on tm, there remains a lack of consensus in research findings about the effect of tm interventions.; objective: the aim of renewing health is to validate and evaluate innovative tm tools on a large scale through a common evaluation, making it easier for decision makers to choose the most efficient and cost-effective technological interventions. the norwegian pilot study evaluates whether the introduction of a mobile phone with a diabetes diary application together with health counseling intervention produces benefits in terms of the desired outcomes, as reflected in the hemoglobin a1c level, health-related quality of life, behavior change, and cost-effectiveness.; methods: the present study has a mixed-method design comprising a three-armed prospective randomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews with study data collected at three time points: baseline, after 4 months, and after 1 year. the patients' registrations on the application are recorded continuously and are sent securely to a server.; results: the inclusion of patients started in march 2011, and 100% of the planned sample size is included (n=151). of all the participants, 26/151 patients (17.2%) are lost to follow-up by now, and 11/151 patients (7.3%) are still in the trial. results of the study protocol will be presented in 2014.; conclusions: the key goals of this trial are to investigate the effect of an electronic diabetes diary app with and without health counseling, and to determine whether health counseling is important to the continued use of the application and the patients' health competence and acceptability. research within this area is needed because few studies have investigated the effectiveness of apps used in long-term interventions with this degree of self-management.; trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct01315756; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01315756 (archived by webcite at http://www.webcitation/6btyurmph).$1
49$;competence in transforming the norwegian welfare sector: a case study and implications for future e-government initiatives;e-government initiatives need to take the competence involved in producing high-quality services for citizens into account. we draw on insights from a pilot project in a norwegian municipal aiming at radically restructuring the norwegian welfare sector and show how the competence to provide highquality services rely on the collective achievement of individuals' knowing-in-practice when dealing with particular cases and situations. furthermore, we show how competence in terms of 'processes of knowing' is intrinsically related to organization structure and existing information systems. transforming the norwegian welfare sector then, involves transforming a sociotechnical network of heterogeneous elements, where existing processes of knowing plays an important role. based on this, we discuss implications for implementing e-government in local municipals, and in particular e-government initiatives that aim at introducing all-embracing integrated it solutions across organizational and geographical borders. the chapter concludes by sketching implications for future research on e-government. © 2009, igi global.$1
50$;access control and integration of health care systems: an experience report and future challenges;health information about a patient is usually scattered among several clinical systems, which limits the availability of the information. integration of the most central systems is a possible solution to this problem. in this paper we present one such integration effort, with a focus on how access control is handled in the integrated system. although this effort has not yet solved all the issues of access control integration, it demonstrates a practical approach for creating something that works today and serves as input to the discussion on future challenges for access control when integrating multiple systems.$1
51$;health assets in nursing documentation of cancer care;patients' experiences, knowledge and preferences, as well as more person-centered care need to be implemented in clinical support systems and are central values and outcomes of ehealth. health assets represent such information. the concept of health assets was explored and described based on analysis of nursing documentation in cancer patients' records. a convenience sample from 100 records, available from a larger study, resulted in 43 records that met the inclusion criteria. these were analyzed using content analysis methods. a mean of 3.2 health assets was documented in these records, and 61% of the descriptions of assets quoted patients. assets were found most often in the admission notes (49%), but no information was found that described or indicated an intended use or follow up in the nursing documentation.$0
52$;re-admissions to hospital and patient satisfaction among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after telemedicine video consultation - a retrospective pilot study;background: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a major cause of acute hospital admissions. the main object of our study was to evaluate the effects of telemedicine video-consultation (tvc) on the frequency of hospital re-admissions due to copd exacerbations. our secondary aim was to assess the impact of tvc on the length of re-admission stays within 6 and 12 months follow up after tvc. patient satisfaction was also evaluated. methods: the study was a retrospective observational study of copd patients who after hospital discharge or during outpatient treatment for acute copd exacerbations, were monitored for 2 weeks by tvc at home by a specialist nurse at the hospital during a pilot project period. retrospectively, we compared the frequencies (chi-square test) and durations of hospital re-admissions (paired t-test) due to copd exacerbations within 6 and 12 months follow up after tvc to comparable events 6 and 12 months prior to tvc. results: among 99 patients followed for 6 months after tvc, 56 were followed for totally 12 months. the number of patients re-admitted and the number of re-admissions due to copd exacerbations were not reduced within 6 or 12 months post-tvc, as compared to 6 and 12 months pre-tvc.the mean length of re-admission stays within 12 months post-tvc was markedly reduced as compared to pre-tvc. patients hospitalised the last 6 and 12 months pre-tvc, had significantly shorter re-admission stays, p = 0.033 and p = 0.001, respectively. patient satisfaction was high. conclusion: despite the failure to demonstrate reduced frequency of re-admissions within 6 and 12 months post-tvc, the re-admission length within 12 months post-tvc was markedly reduced as compared to pre-tvc. the patient satisfaction was high. future prospective, randomised, controlled trials must be performed before tvc can be recommended in copd management.$1
53$;the workload of web-based consultations with atopic eczema patients at home;background. atopic eczema is a chronic inflammatory non-contagious skin disease characterised by intensive itch and inflamed skin. due to its chronic and relapsing course atopic eczema imposes a great burden on affected families. review articles about home care telemedicine have indicated advantageous effects of home telehealth. however, few studies have investigated how home care telemedicine applications affect the workload of the clinician. methods. the use of a web-based counselling system was recorded through computerised logging. the doctor who answered the requests sent via the internet recorded the amount of time needed for reading and answering 93 consecutive requests. results. the time needed by the physician to read and answer a request was less than 5 minutes in 60% of the cases. the doctor spent significantly more time to answer requests that had photographs attached compared to requests without photographs (p = 0.005). the time needed to answer requests received during the winter season (october-march) was significantly longer than the rest of the year (p = 0.023). there was no correlation between the answering time and the age of the patient. conclusions. individual web-based follow-up of atopic eczema patients at home is feasible. the amount of time needed for the doctor to respond to a request from the patient appears to be small. the answering time seems to depend on whether photographs are supplied and also on seasonal variations of disease activity. since the management of atopic eczema is complex involving many different types of treatments and educational aspects, we expect this type of communication to be useful also to other chronic disease patients requiring close follow-up. © 2010 schopf et al.$1

55$;'big needles, small bodies' - the absence of acupuncture treatment for infants in contemporary shanghai: a qualitative study;objective: to explore contemporary practices and clinical recommendations regarding the use of acupuncture for infants by traditional chinese medicine (tcm) practitioners in shanghai. design: a qualitative study consisting of four field visits between february 2014 and march 2015. data was collected using participant observation, focus group interview, in-depth interview, textbook page analysis and informant validation. participants: 14 shanghainese professionals, including interpreters and tcm practitioners, of which seven were acupuncturists. setting: the longhua hospital (paediatric, acupuncture and tui na departments) in southern shanghai and the campus of the shanghai university of traditional chinese medicine. results: the longhua hospital outpatient acupuncture clinic receives 400 consultations on average per day. children, including patients from the paediatric department, are referred to this clinic. during 3 days of participant observations at this department, we saw two children. no infants. during 3 days at the paediatric department and 1 day at the tui na department we saw no referrals. formal interviews and informal conversations with acupuncturists and other tcm professionals revealed that acupuncture was neither routinely practiced nor recommended for infants and small children. acupuncture was considered potentially painful for this young patient population. alternative treatment options such as herbal treatments or medical massage were widely available and preferred. western medical diagnostics and treatment were also used, recommended, and trusted. conclusions: acupuncture for infants is not a preferred therapeutic method among tcm practitioners working in contemporary shanghai. acupuncture on broad indications in infants appears to be a western practice with little basis in tcm modern-day practice. © 2015, bmj publishing group. all rights reserved.$0
56$;mobile communication in hospitals: what is the problem?;the work setting in hospitals is communication intensive and can lead to significant difficulties related to interruptions from co-workers. physicians often need information fast, and any delay between the decision made and the action taken could cause medical errors. one suggested solution for this problem is to implement wireless phone systems. however, psychological theory and empirical evidence, both suggest that wireless phones have the potential of creating additional problems related to interruptions, compared to traditional paging systems. the fact that hospital workers prefer interruptive communication methods before non-interruptive methods, amplifies the risk of overloading people when phones are widely deployed. this challenge causes some hospital staff to resist the diffusion of wireless phones, and a key is how to handle the balance between increased availability, and increased interruptions. in this chapter, the authors present solutions based on context aware communication systems, aiming to reduce interruptions. © 2015 by igi global. all rights reserved.$1
57$;towards a tomographic framework for structured observation of communicative behaviour in hospital wards;the research presented in this paper investigates how observation of information- and communication-intensive work in hospital wards can be used to produce requirements for mobile clinical information systems. over a number of years, we have explored how important properties of clinical situations can be captured through structured observations of actors, processes, and systems. in the paper, we present experience from four observational studies of a total of more than 400 hours in hospital wards. based on the observational studies, we propose a framework for structured, tomographic, observation of clinical work practice. we also briefly discuss and illustrate how the field data can be analyzed and used as input to the requirements engineering process.$0
58$;developing and implementing patients' full-scale electronic access to their health record;to increase patients' empowerment and involvement in their own health, several countries has decided to provide patients with electronic access to their health record. this paper reports on the main findings from sub-studies and pilots prior to the implementation of patients' access to their medical records in large-scale in the northern norway region. the largest pilot included nearly 500 patients. data for the participatory design process was collected through questionnaires and interviews. the results revealed that the service in general functioned as expected. the patients reported that they would continue to use the service, recommend it to others, and generally had no problems in understanding the content.$1
59$;towards interactive virtual environments through handheld devices for the disabled: a performance-evaluation perspective;the successful integration of novel interactive virtual environments for everyday life applications may constitute an important indication towards similarly employing virtual reality (vr)-related technologies in primary care. this chapter presents the results of a usability study that makes use of an android-based handheld device for investigating disabled users' performance in using an intuitive interactive vr interface for pain assessment. a convenience sample of seven wheelchair users was asked to evaluate the interface and involved the use of non-participant direct observation, note taking, and thinking-aloud protocol to collect the necessary data. the evaluation results demonstrated good acceptance and a generally positive performance of the participants when they completed a set of predefined interaction tasks. it is anticipated that the findings of this study may have good practical implications to the assessment of pain and could open the way for increasing the use of such technologies in everyday healthcare provision. © 2014, igi global. all right reserved.$1
60$;standard for personalized ehealth services;stimulated by the rapid development in ict, wireless communication and sensor development, patient care is moving out of the institution and into the personal realm. the move requires that ehealth systems should be tailored to the user, including personalization and adaptation to user context. this paper describes ongoing work to establish a standard for such personalization. the standard builds on the user's preferences and current situation, which together define the current user profile. this profile can then be used by ehealth services and devices to ensure a user experience tailored to each person and situation. the work surveys relevant areas of personalization, like identity management, profile management etc, addressing those aspects of personalization that are specific to ehealth: user capabilities, care provider roles and functions, health related information, and confidentiality measures.$1
61$;the mobel project: experiences from applying user-centered methods for designing mobile ict for hospitals;this chapter presents results and experiences from the mobel (mobile electronic patient record) project at the norwegian university of science and technology (ntnu) in trondheim, norway. mobel was a multidisciplinary research project established in 2000. the problem area of the project was communication and information needs in hospital wards, and the aim of the project was to develop and explore methods and prototypes for point of care clinical information systems (poccs) that support clinicians in their patient-centered activities. the chapter summarizes four sub studies performed during the project. each study presents different approaches to user-centered design of poccs. findings from these studies confirm the need for mobile information and communication technology (ict) in hospitals. furthermore, the studies demonstrate how more user involvement and complementary approaches to traditional requirements engineering (re) and system development methods can be useful when developing mobile information and communication systems for clinicians. © 2010, igi global.$1
62$;increasing physical activity efficiently: an experimental pilot study of a website and mobile phone intervention;the main objective of this pilot study was to test the effectiveness of an online, interactive physical activity intervention that also incorporated gaming components. the intervention design included an activity planner, progress monitoring, and gamification components and used sms text as a secondary delivery channel and feedback to improve engagement in the intervention content. healthy adults (n = 21) recruited through ads in local newspapers (age 35-73) were randomized to the intervention or the control condition. both groups reported physical activity using daily report forms in four registration weeks during the three-month study: only the experiment condition received access to the intervention. analyses showed that the intervention group had significantly more minutes of physical activity in weeks five and nine. we also found a difference in the intensity of exercise in week five. although the intervention group reported more minutes of physical activity at higher intensity levels, we were not able to find a significant effect at the end of the study period. in conclusion, this study adds to the research on the effectiveness of using the internet and sms text messages for delivering physical activity interventions and supports gamification as a viable intervention tool.$0
63$";the future of telemedicine in o&g;this paper presents an ongoing work in on the future of telemedicine in o&g. there has been a huge development in the use of video consultation between remote patients and the doctors. we believe the future of telemedicine in o&g will add to this workflow by investigating how we can transfer visual medical data between ""offshore nurses"" and ""medical experts"" at hospitals onshore in order to improve diagnostics and treatment. we will describe a decision support system that supports an optimal workflow and collaboration, between medics onshore and offshore. the goal is to make better and faster medical decisions, and improve the quality of healthcare offshore. the oil companies have much of the same structure and same challenges in remote medical treatment. we investigate an optimal workflow including how technology supports a new telemedicine work process by transmitting very high quality information (e.g. ultrasound images) to the cardiovascular medical experts. we will review our work on developing a prototype ""on the go"" solution between medics offshore and the medical experts onshore at the hospital. the concept will be based on a pad/pc solution capturing the ultrasound image transmission between the user and experts, a systematic work process and a knowledge base integrated in the pad/pc ""on the go solution"". with optimal workflow it should not take more than 5-7 minutes from the starting point to have a decision from the medical expert. this will improve diagnostics, medical safety and health quality on offshore installations. copyright 2014, society of petroleum engineers."$1

66$;oivos: simple and efficient distributed data processing;the complexity of implementing large scale distributed computations has motivated new programming models. google's mapreduce model has gained widespread use and aims to hide the complex details of data partitioning and distribution, scheduling, synchronization, and fault tolerance. however our experiences from the enterprise search business indicate that many real-life applications must be implemented as a collection of related mapreduce programs. since the execution of these programs must be monitored and coordinated externally, several issues concerning scheduling, synchronization and fault tolerance resurface. to address these limitations, we introduce oivos; a high-level declarative programming model and its underlying run-time. we show how oivos programs may specify computations that span multiple heterogeneous and interdependent data sets, how the programs are compiled and optimized, and how our run-time orchestrates and monitors their distributed execution. our experimental evaluation reveals that oivos programs do less i/o and execute significantly faster than the equivalent sequences of mapreduce passes.$0
67$;current modalities for invasive and non-invasive monitoring of volume status in heart failure;heart failure (hf) represents a major health and economic burden worldwide. in spite of best current therapy, hf progresses with unpredictable episodes of deterioration that often require hospitalisation. these episodes are often preceded by accumulation or redistribution of fluid causing haemodynamic overload on the heart. remote and telemonitoring of the hf patient, assessing symptoms and signs, thoracic impedance derived fluid status follow-up or direct haemodynamic measurements with chronic implanted devices are presently under investigation for the potential to detect impending hf decompensation early. the current evidence for volume status monitoring in hf using those novel management strategies is reviewed.$0
68$;traceability in model-driven software development;this chapter introduces a tracability solution for use in a model-driven software development approach. it argues that a trace model based on a provided traceability metamodel will provide a flexible solution for all types of artifacts to be traced througout the lifetime of a software system. the proposed traceability solution is demonstrated in the buscatcher example where traces are established and analyzed. the authors hope that the metamodel and solution design can assist researchers and tool vendors in the development of unified trace models and services for model-driven software development approaches. only then can the full potential of traceability be achieved. © 2009, igi global.$0
69$;a computationally efficient algorithm for genomic prediction using a bayesian model;background: genomic prediction of breeding values from dense single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) genotypes is used for livestock and crop breeding, and can also be used to predict disease risk in humans. for some traits, the most accurate genomic predictions are achieved with non-linear estimates of snp effects from bayesian methods that treat snp effects as random effects from a heavy tailed prior distribution. these bayesian methods are usually implemented via markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) schemes to sample from the posterior distribution of snp effects, which is computationally expensive. our aim was to develop an efficient expectation-maximisation algorithm (embayesr) that gives similar estimates of snp effects and accuracies of genomic prediction than the mcmc implementation of bayesr (a bayesian method for genomic prediction), but with greatly reduced computation time. methods: embayesr is an approximate em algorithm that retains the bayesr model assumption with snp effects sampled from a mixture of normal distributions with increasing variance. embayesr differs from other proposed non-mcmc implementations of bayesian methods for genomic prediction in that it estimates the effect of each snp while allowing for the error associated with estimation of all other snp effects. embayesr was compared to bayesr using simulated data, and real dairy cattle data with 632 003 snps genotyped, to determine if the mcmc and the expectation-maximisation approaches give similar accuracies of genomic prediction. results: we were able to demonstrate that allowing for the error associated with estimation of other snp effects when estimating the effect of each snp in embayesr improved the accuracy of genomic prediction over embayesr without including this error correction, with both simulated and real data. when averaged over nine dairy traits, the accuracy of genomic prediction with embayesr was only 0.5% lower than that from bayesr. however, embayesr reduced computing time up to 8-fold compared to bayesr. conclusions: the embayesr algorithm described here achieved similar accuracies of genomic prediction to bayesr for a range of simulated and real 630 k dairy snp data. embayesr needs less computing time than bayesr, which will allow it to be applied to larger datasets. © 2015 wang et al.$0
70$;you are not at all bothersome - nurses' online communication with testicular cancer patients;to some extent, electronic communication has supplemented nurses' face-to-face contact with patients over the last few years. in this paper, we report findings from a study in which we examined cancer nurses' answers to messages from testicular cancer patients in a nurse-managed online patient-provider communication service. the aim of the study was to investigate how nurses manage to meet patients' different questions and concerns, and what aspects of expert nursing care are demonstrated when they communicate with patients online. the content of the messages formed a continuum from practical to existential issues. in their answers, the nurses demonstrated an ability to make reflected choices between both support modalities and means of communication. the professional knowledge and care of expert cancer nurses were clearly exposed in the nurses' answers, although they were good at adapting their professional language so that it would be understandable to the patients.$0
71$;in what circumstances is telemedicine appropriate in the developing world?;objectives: to review papers reporting actual experience with telemedicine in developing countries and to summarize their findings, including the strength of the evidence. design: a retrospective review was conducted. study quality was assessed. setting: four commonly-used electronic databases. main outcome measures: study quality scores. results: from a total of 202 potential articles, 38 relevant papers were identified. thirty-four articles (89%) reported clinical experience and 14 articles (37%) reported the use of telemedicine for educational purposes. the quality of the reports was rather weak (median quality-score 3, on a scale 0-9); only one study, rated at 7, fell into the high quality score band. the fact that almost all studies reported positively in favour of telemedicine suggests a publication bias. of the 38 articles, 15 (39%) reported the use of real-time telemedicine and 25 (66%) reported the use of asynchronous, or store-and-forward, telemedicine. email was the most commonly reported modality (half of all studies). conclusion: some of the longer established telemedicine operations have developed into substantial networks. the review suggests that great potential exists for telemedicine in the developing world. however, some caution is required in future telemedicine work if telemedicine exemplars are to be produced which can be widely copied.$1
72$";experimental e-health applications in wireless sensor networks;in this paper, we will describe the implementation and experimental analysis of a wireless sensor network application for e-health. the main idea of the application is to use simple distributed sensor nodes in a home environment, to provide home assistants, nurses, healthcare centers and relatives with a degree of ""understanding"" and information about the actual persons health and activity status in order to fast determine what kind of help is needed. another feature of the with the sensor application is the application of localization and tracking within the home environment. we propose a simple localization algorithm based on special sensor data and received signal strength indicator (rssi) which has a low complexity suitable for small sensor networks. the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works fine in a home environment. © 2009 ieee."$1
73$";coding on networks;in conventional communication networks data protection is achieved via forward error correction (fec) which are implemented in the physical (phy) layer. in this paper we propose a novel technique that will provide additional reliability by exploiting excess network capacity and modifying upper layers (e.g. networking and applications). the proposed technique is generic and could be applicable to any existing network, both wired and wireless. some examples of such networks include (but not limited to) wimax, 3g, wifi, etc. in this particular research sponsored by eu marie currie tok project ""net- on-demand"" we focus our research on wireless ad-hoc sensor networks, which have a wide range of applications, varying from security to environment monitoring and e-health. in the main paper we describe a modified galager algorithm for flow optimal routing, which allows redundant paths to be utilised for additional information protection. this would lead to higher reliability of the transmitted data and potentially to higher throughputs in the existing networks, thus providing additional services without capital expenditure. in the main paper we will present detailed description of the modified galager algorithm and describe its implementation in the existing communication networks. we also will define a set of network parameters that will be used for comparison purposes and present simulation results that confirm and illustrate achieved goals."$0
74$;automatic segmentation of dermoscopic images by iterative classification;accurate detection of the borders of skin lesions is a vital first step for computer aided diagnostic systems. this paper presents a novel automatic approach to segmentation of skin lesions that is particularly suitable for analysis of dermoscopic images. assumptions about the image acquisition, in particular, the approximate location and color, are used to derive an automatic rule to select small seed regions, likely to correspond to samples of skin and the lesion of interest. the seed regions are used as initial training samples, and the lesion segmentation problem is treated as binary classification problem. an iterative hybrid classification strategy, based on a weighted combination of estimated posteriors of a linear and quadratic classifier, is used to update both the automatically selected training samples and the segmentation, increasing reliability and final accuracy, especially for those challenging images, where the contrast between the background skin and lesion is low.$1

153$activities of daily living; alzheimer disease; self-help devices;matching user needs to technology in dementia care: experiences with the alma supervisor educational program;the number of individuals with dementia in norway is more than 78,000, and, as in all other european countries, this figure is expected to rise over the coming decades. the norwegian health directorate encourages municipalities to make use of ‘welfare technology’ in order to contribute to independent living and quality of life in older adults, to increase the quality of community health care, to save time when providing community health services and to reduce costs, e.g. admission to a nursing home. introducing welfare technology to care recipients requires innovation on the part of the community health care service with regard to increasing the competency of the staff in the operation of the technologies, as well as in establishing an infrastructure for ‘digital communication’. research has shown that access to assistive technology may support individuals with mild cognitive impairments, as well as in an early phase of dementia. however, it is crucial that the technology addresses an identified need, and that the device is tailored to the person’s preferences and context. therefore, it is important to train health professionals to assess the user’s needs and preferences and to identify resources and limitations in the particular context. alma’s house in oslo is a demonstration site and education center for welfare technologies. the education program for the certification of alma supervisors has become an important strategy in educating occupational therapists (ots) and nurses on how to assess user needs, identify appropriate technology and implement this into the care recipient’s home. © wydawnictwo continuo.$1

155$activity monitoring; older persons; physical activity; validation; applied statistics; social participation; technical systems; validation protocols; health;recommendations for standardizing validation procedures assessing physical activity of older persons by monitoring body postures and movements;physical activity is an important determinant of health and well-being in older persons and contributes to their social participation and quality of life. hence, assessment tools are needed to study this physical activity in free-living conditions. wearable motion sensing technology is used to assess physical activity. however, there is a lack of harmonisation of validation protocols and applied statistics, which make it hard to compare available and future studies. therefore, the aim of this paper is to formulate recommendations for assessing the validity of sensor-based activity monitoring in older persons with focus on the measurement of body postures and movements. validation studies of body-worn devices providing parameters on body postures and movements were identified and summarized and an extensive inter-active process between authors resulted in recommendations about: information on the assessed persons, the technical system, and the analysis of relevant parameters of physical activity, based on a standardized and semi-structured protocol. the recommended protocols can be regarded as a first attempt to standardize validity studies in the area of monitoring physical activity. © 2014 by the authors; licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.$0

184$adoption; barriers; implementation; telehealth; telemedicine;adoption of routine telemedicine in norwegian hospitals: progress over 5 years;background: although norway is well known for its early use of telemedicine to provide services for people in rural and remote areas in the arctic, little is known about the pace of telemedicine adoption in norway. the aim of the present study was to explore the statewide implementation of telemedicine in norwegian hospitals over time, and analyse its adoption and level of use. methods: data on outpatient visits and telemedicine consultations delivered by norwegian hospitals from 2009 to 2013 were collected from the national health registry. data were stratified by health region, hospital, year, and clinical specialty. results: all four health regions used telemedicine, i.e. there was 100 % adoption at the regional level. the use of routine telemedicine differed between health regions, and telemedicine appeared to be used mostly in the regions of lower centrality and population density, such as northern norway. only central norway seemed to be atypical. twenty-one out of 28 hospitals reported using telemedicine, i.e. there was 75 % adoption at the hospital level. neurosurgery and rehabilitation were the clinical specialties where telemedicine was used most frequently. despite the growing trend and the high adoption, the relative use of telemedicine compared to that of outpatient visits was low. conclusions: adoption of telemedicine is norway was high, with all the health regions and most of the hospitals reporting using telemedicine. the use of telemedicine appeared to increase over the 5-year study period. however, the proportion of telemedicine consultations relative to the number of outpatient visits was low. the use of telemedicine in norway was low in comparison with that reported in large-scale telemedicine networks in other countries. to facilitate future comparisons, data on adoption and utilisation over time should be reported routinely by statewide or network-based telemedicine services.$1

353$bioinformatics; confidentiality; datashield; disclosure; distributed computing; elsi; intellectual property; pooled analysis; privacy;datashield: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis;background: research in modern biomedicine and social science requires sample sizes so large that they can often only be achieved through a pooled co-analysis of data from several studies. but the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. in the uk this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the uk's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. datashield provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. methods: commands are sent from a central analysis computer (ac) to several data computers (dcs) storing the data to be co-analysed. the data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. the separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the dcs and the ac. this paper describes the technical implementation of datashield using a modified r statistical environment linked to an opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each dc. analysis is controlled through a standard r environment at the ac. results: based on this opal/r implementation, datashield is currently used by the healthy obese project and the environmental core project (bioshare-eu) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight european countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the datashield approach. conclusions: datashield facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis. © the author 2014; all rights reserved.$1

432$child protection; decision making; dependency hearings; participation; protective care;representation of children's views in court hearings about custody and parental visitations - a comparison between what children wanted and what the courts ruled;purpose: following the un convention on the rights of children, a shift in policy towards greater emphasis on child participation in child protection case processing has occurred. a growing body of research has emerged concerning participation processes in child protection cases and the experiences of children in child protection cases. very few studies have looked into if and when children get what they want, however. the aim of this study is to assess children's views about living arrangements and visitations in dependency court hearings and to compare these views with the rulings of courts. method: the study uses a retrospective cohort design. cases where child welfare board rulings are in line with the wishes of children are compared to cases where rulings differ from the wishes of children. data were collected from regional social welfare board archives. the study included 151 cases that were randomly drawn from a total population of 2481 cases. simple and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the rulings being in accord with the child's wishes in each sample case. results: a child advocate was appointed in almost 95% of the cases (n=142). fifty-nine percent of the children did not want a change in care. rulings about care were in line with the wishes of the child in 39% of the cases. rulings about care were most likely to be what the child wanted, if the child was presently living in public care and did not want to move. children wanted more visitations with their mothers in 60.5% of the cases and with their fathers in 39.8% of the cases. whether children wanted more visitations with their mothers was associated with more visitations being granted. what a child wanted was not associated with the ruling on visitations with the child's father. conclusion: the impact of children's views on visitations on dependency court rulings depends on what a child wants and how these desires coincide with what is proposed by child protection services. children's views can be quite effective in blocking certain decisions but are less effective if the child requested a specific change. if a child does not want to stay with his or her birth parents, then the odds that the birth parents will be granted custody is minimal. © 2013 elsevier ltd.$0

460$clinical decision support system; electronic health records; mental health informatics; neurodevelopmental disorders;clinical decision support systems in child and adolescent psychiatry: a systematic review;psychiatric disorders are amongst the most prevalent and impairing conditions in childhood and adolescence. unfortunately, it is well known that general practitioners (gps) and other frontline health providers (i.e., child protection workers, public health nurses, and pediatricians) are not adequately trained to address these ubiquitous problems (braddick et al. child and adolescent mental health in europe: infrastructures, policy and programmes, european communities, 2009; levav et al. eur child adolesc psychiatry 13:395-401, 2004). advances in technology may offer a solution to this problem with clinical decision support systems (cdss) that are designed to help professionals make sound clinical decisions in real time. this paper offers a systematic review of currently available cdss for child and adolescent mental health disorders prepared according to the prisma-protocols (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols). applying strict eligibility criteria, the identified studies (n = 5048) were screened. ten studies, describing eight original clinical decision support systems for child and adolescent psychiatric disorders, fulfilled inclusion criteria. based on this systematic review, there appears to be a need for a new, readily available cdss for child neuropsychiatric disorder which promotes evidence-based, best practices, while enabling consideration of national variation in practices by leveraging data-reuse to generate predictions regarding treatment outcome, addressing a broader cluster of clinical disorders, and targeting frontline practice environments.$1

530$engineering; medical informatics;implementing informed consent as information-flow policies for secure analytics on ehealth data: principles and practices;wearable and ambient cyber-physical systems coupled with big-data health analytics promise continuous individual health monitoring and customized medical interventions. however, health workers and medical researchers are bound by strict security and privacy conventions that make it difficult to take advantage of emerging data streams. in this paper, we propose a security and privacy architecture for the analytics back-end in medical cyber-physical systems. our approach is motivated by three principles: users behave mostly rational, informed consent are security policies, and deep revocation of granted rights. we propose implementing these principles using a novel combination of information-flow control with attested programs for data declassification in combination with auditing and credential-based access control. our implementation relies on fine-grained encapsulation of data sets and processing components inside virtual-machine containers. we therefore evaluate our ability to host concurrent linux containers, and observe that 70 instances can be easily accommodated on commodity hardware.$1

564$focus groups; healthcare professionals; home healthcare; telecare; training needs; vocational training;perceptions of telecare training needs in home healthcare services: a focus group study;background: the implementation and use of telecare requires significant changes to healthcare service organisation and delivery, including new ways of working for staff. competency development and training for healthcare professionals is therefore required to enable necessary adaptation of clinical practice and ensure competent provision of telecare services. it is however unclear what skills healthcare staff need when providing care at a distance and there is little empirical evidence on effective training strategies for telecare practice. training should however emphasise the experiences and preferences of prospective trainees to ensure its relevance to their educational needs. the aim of this study was to explore healthcare professionals' perceptions of training related to the general use of telecare, and to identify specific training needs associated with the use of virtual visits in the home healthcare services. methods: six focus group interviews were held with a total of 26 participants working in the home healthcare services in norway, including registered nurses, enrolled nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, health workers, and healthcare assistants. the data material was analysed by way of systematic text condensation. results: the analysis resulted in five categories relevant to telecare training for healthcare professionals: purposeful training creates confidence and changes attitudes; training needs depend on ability to cope with telecare; the timing of training; training must facilitate practical insight into the patients' perspective; and training content must focus on the telecare process. findings are discussed in light of implications for the form and content of a training program for healthcare professionals on how to undertake virtual home healthcare visits. conclusion: appropriate preparation and training for telecare use is important for healthcare professionals and must be taken seriously by healthcare organisations. to facilitate the knowledge, skills and attitudes required for new ways of working and enable quality and safety in telecare practice, staff should be provided with training as part of telecare implementation processes. telecare training should be hands-on and encourage an overall patient-centred approach to care to ensure good patient-professional relationships at a distance.$1

583$governance; lightweight it;a governance model for managing lightweight it;the widespread introduction of lightweight it—smartphones, tablets, the internet of things, and the growth of third-party app developers—has become a challenge for many organizations. local units and end-users increasingly are acquiring and implementing lightweight it outside the realm of the it function. the trend is driven by competent users’ need for innovative it services, enabled by the consumerization of digital technologies. lightweight it entails exciting business opportunities; however, guidance for managers on how to deal with this development has been very limited. in this paper, we investigate which it governance models organizations can apply to manage lightweight it. the managerial challenge is to balance the innovative potential of lightweight it with the requirements of good governance. building on the particular challenges of lightweight it and the extant literature on end-user computing, we present a framework with four alternative governance models. we evaluate the framework through four ehealth case studies. © springer international publishing ag 2017.$0

592$health care sciences & services;ict and patient roles; contradictions in e-health policy;patient oriented information and communication technologies (ict), often labelled e-health, are on the rise in european health care. how does this affect patient roles? on the one hand e-health is argued to stimulate an active empowered patient, but on the other recent empirical studies link e-health to the survival of a passive compliant patient role. in this study of secondary sources 20 e-health policy and related documents from the european union were investigated to identify dominant conceptualizations of the patient role in e-health policy. the findings highlight how the policy rhetoric on patient involvement through e-health relies on the aspects of information and consumerism, and that this rhetoric, paradoxically, has the unintended effect of strengthening the opposing ideal of the compliant patient. the study aims to open for a broader discussion on the potential and limitations of e-health in future patient care and treatment.

658$information systems; evaluation; tool functionality; clinical; guidelines; authoring tools;tool support for maintaining clinical guidelines: a case study;clinical guideline development is a complex and time-consuming process. authors involved in the development of clinical guidelines need appropriate software support to develop the guidelines and to publish them in a sufficiently formal and systematic way as the contents require constant maintenance through the lifetime of the guidelines. this paper presents the results of a case study performed on the process of maintaining national clinical guidelines in norway. the aim of the case study is to identify challenges and issues the guideline authors face during the process of updating, especially with respect to information systems support. eight selected authors from four different organizations involved in the process of authoring, disseminating, and updating the guidelines participated in the study. semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect feedback about the provided information systems in their organizations. in addition, the subjects were observed during a normal workday while maintaining guidelines. analysis of the results shows gaps and shortcomings in the present information systems. the information systems designed to support guideline authors are neither integrated in a desired way nor do they fulfil the users' needs in terms of functionality. some observed deficits are: proper reference management systems, standardized terminologies, version controls, archiving systems, tracking of updates, and provisions of proper guideline templates. in addition, the lack of process support by the information systems forces additional external communication between different guideline authors. the case study results contribute to establishing a common understanding of requirements for designing an integrated guideline development infrastructure.$1

665$integrated operations; remote operations; sensework;remoteness and sensework in harsh environments;there is a general trend of more distributed work configurations in many work domains, examples being air traffic management and telemedicine. as the offshore petroleum industry conquers increasingly remote and harsh areas, there is a pressure towards lower offshore staffing and more sensor-based onshore management. this introduces new challenges of control and safety. integrated operation (io) addresses many of the challenges associated with remoteness. io denotes an operating philosophy where new technologies and work processes make possible an increased use of real-time data and collaboration across geographical distances and professional disciplines. it presupposes clearly defined work processes, and a strong division of labour with respect to decision making and execution. in this article, interpretation work, decision making and execution are investigated through the lenses of sensework. sensework denotes sociotechnical work in safety–critical operations where groups of professionals try to put together pieces of information to give meaning to familiar and unfamiliar situations. the division of labour and the envisioned decision making processes of io build on assumptions that are not necessarily valid for distributed sensework in remote areas or modes. sensework is characterised by close, iterative interaction with nature through the use of sensor data and digital representations, implying that decisions are problematic to make for experts that are not really engaged with the operational context. there is a need for more research on and refinement of models for operating in remote areas or modes. in particular, there is a need for harmonisation between technological solutions and organisational arrangements. © 2016 the author$0

681$"learning automata; spatio-temporal pattern recognition;learning automaton based on-line discovery and tracking of spatio-temporal event patterns;discovering and tracking of spatio-temporal patterns in noisy sequences of events is a difficult task that has become increasingly pertinent due to recent advances in ubiquitous computing, such as community-based social networking applications. the core activities for applications of this class include the sharing and notification of events, and the importance and usefulness of these functionalites increases as event-sharing expands into larger areas of one's life. ironically, instead of being helpful, an excessive number of event notifications can quickly render the functionality of event-sharing to be obtrusive. rather, any notification of events that provides redundant information to the application/user can be seen to be an unnecessary distraction. in this paper, we introduce a new scheme for discovering and tracking noisy spatio-temporal event patterns, with the purpose of suppressing reoccurring patterns, while discerning novel events. our scheme is based on maintaining a collection of hypotheses, each one conjecturing a. specific spatio-temporal event pattern. a dedicated learning automaton (la) - the spatio-temporal pattern la (stpla) - is associated with each hypothesis. by processing events as they unfold, we attempt to infer the correctness of each hypothesis through a real-time guided random walk. consequently, the scheme we present is computationally efficient, with a minimal memory footprint. furthermore, it is ergodic, allowing adaptation. empirical results involving extensive simulations demonstrate the stpla's superior convergence and adaptation speed, as well as an ability to operate successfully with noise, including both the erroneous inclusion and omission of events. additionally, the results included, which involve a so-called ""presence sharing"" application, are both promising and in our opinion, impressive. it is thus our opinion that the proposed stpla scheme is, in general, ideal for improving the usefulness of event notification and sharing systems, since it is capable of significantly, robustly and adaptively suppressing redundant information."$0

687$lmics; quality assurance; quality control; telehealth; telemedicine;quality assurance of teleconsultations in a store-and-forward telemedicine network - obtaining patient follow-up data and user feedback;user surveys in telemedicine networks confirm that follow-up data are essential, both for the specialists who provide advice and for those running the system. we have examined the feasibility of a method for obtaining follow-up data automatically in a store-and-forward network. we distinguish between follow-up, which is information about the progress of a patient and is based on outcomes, and user feedback, which is more general information about the telemedicine system itself, including user satisfaction and the benefits resulting from the use of telemedicine. in the present study, we were able to obtain both kinds of information using a single questionnaire. during a 9-month pilot trial in the medecins sans frontieres telemedicine network, an email request for information was sent automatically by the telemedicine system to each referrer exactly 21 days after the initial submission of the case. a total of 201 requests for information were issued by the system and these elicited 41 responses from referrers (a response rate of 20%). the responses were largely positive. for example, 95% of referrers found the advice helpful, 90% said that it clarified their diagnosis, 94% said that it assisted with management of the patient, and 95% said that the telemedicine response was of educational benefit to them. analysis of the characteristics of the referrers who did not respond, and their cases, did not suggest anything different about them in comparison with referrers who did respond. we were not able to identify obvious factors associated with a failure to respond. obtaining data by automatic request is feasible. it provides useful information for specialists and for those running the network. since obtaining follow-up data is essential to best practice, one proposal to improve the response rate is to simplify the automatic requests so that only patient follow-up information is asked for, and to restrict user feedback requests to the cases being assessed each month by the quality assurance panel.$1
688$lmics; quality assurance; quality control; telehealth; telemedicine;relationship between the quality of service provided through store-and-forward telemedicine consultations and the difficulty of the cases - implications for long-term quality assurance;we examined the difficulty of telemedicine cases and the quality of the resultant consultation in a mature store-and-forward telemedicine network. a random sample of 10 telemedicine cases was selected from those occurring over a 3-month period (5% of the workload) and they were scored by three experienced observers. inter-observer agreement on the difficulty scores was poor (fleiss's kappa = 0.18) and it was also poor on the consultation quality scores (fleiss's kappa = 0.11). differences between observers were minimized by consensus scoring, and the cases were re-assessed jointly by two observers. based on the consensus scores, there was a weak negative relation between output quality and case difficulty, i.e., the more difficult cases tended to result in lower quality consultations. however, the effect was non-significant (p = 0.59) and a larger study might be helpful. in the meantime, routine monitoring of telemedicine service quality will continue in the interests of quality assurance. as yet, there is no evidence on which to base a correction for case difficulty.$1

706$mobile health; type 2 diabetes; self-management; intervention;usage and perceptions of a mobile self-management application for people with type 2 diabetes: qualitative study of a five-month trial;despite a growing number of clinical-intervention studies of mobile applications for diabetes self-management, details of participants' engagement with the intervention tools and of usability and feasibility issues are seldom reported. the few touch application is a mobile-phone-based self-management system for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) developed by involving patient-users in design processes from an early phase to a long-term trial. an improved version was tested in a five-month trial by 11 individuals either with t2dm or at high risk of t2dm. results showed clearer correlations between usage and perceived usefulness among these individuals compared with those involved in the design process. however, feedback on usability issues was mostly consistent between the two trials. this study therefore confirmed: 1) the value of including patient-users not only in design-concept development but also in a long-term trial to identify as many factors critical to usability and usage as possible, and 2) the importance of reflecting their feedback in design iterations to minimize the number of critical factors.$1
707$mobile radiography service; nursing homes; socio-economics; telemedicine; x-ray;mobile radiography services in nursing homes: a systematic review of residents' and societal outcomes;background: demographic changes are leading to an ageing population in europe, and predict an increase in the number of nursing home residents over the next 30 years. nursing home residents need specialised healthcare services such as radiology due to both chronic and acute illnesses. mobile radiography, x-ray examinations performed in the nursing homes, may be a good way of providing services to this population. the aim of this systematic review was to identify the outcomes of mobile radiography services for nursing home residents and society. methods: a systematic review based on searches in the medline, cochrane, pubmed, embase and svemed + databases was performed. titles and abstracts were screened according to a predefined set of inclusion criteria: empirical studies in the geriatric population, and reports of mobile radiography services in a clinical setting. all publications were quality appraised using mmat or casp appraisal tools. data were extracted using a summary table and results were narratively synthesised. results: ten publications were included. three overarching outcomes were identified: 1) reduced number of hospitalisations and outpatient examinations or treatments, 2) reduced number of transfers between nursing homes and hospitals and 3) increased access to x-ray examinations. these outcomes were interlinked with the more specific outcomes for residents and society reported in the literature. for residents there was a reduction in burdensome transfers and waiting time and adequate treatment and care increased. for society, released resources could be used more efficiently, and overall costs were reduced substantially. conclusions: this review indicates that mobile radiography services for nursing home residents in the western world are of comparable quality to hospital-based examinations and have clear potential benefits. mobile radiography reduced transfers to and from hospital, increased the number of examinations carried out and facilitated timely diagnosis and access to treatments. further research is needed to formally evaluate potential improvements in care quality and cost-effectiveness.$1

710$moderation; online communities; prototype; social media; media industry; power balance; wikipedia; online systems;multi-dimensional moderation in online communities: experiences with three norwegian sites;online-communities and user contribution of content have become widespread over the last years. this has triggered new and innovative web concepts, and perhaps also changed the power balance in the society. many large corporations have embraced this way of creating content to their sites, which has raised concerns regarding abusive content. previous research has identified two main different types of moderation; one where the users have most of the control as in wikipedia, and the other where the owners control everything. the media industry, in particular, are reluctant to loose the control of their content by using the member-maintained approach even if it has proven to cost less and be more efficient. this research proposes to merge these two moderation types through a concept called multidimensional moderation. to test this concept, two prototype solutions have been implemented and tested in large-scale discussion groups. the results from this study show that a combination of owner and user moderation may enhance the moderation process. © 2009 springer berlin heidelberg.$0

734$patient monitoring; data acquisition-data capture; human interfaces;a system for monitoring physical activity data among people with type 2 diabetes;trends towards lower levels of physical activity have raised health concerns. tools to capture, store and use information about physical activity might improve motivation to increase the level of such activity. this is especially important for type 2 diabetes, since physical activity is one of the key components in achieving healthy blood glucose values. over a period of four months, 15 people with type 2 diabetes provided us with input on how a mobile system needs to be put together. generally, they answered that such tools must be integrated as well as possible with their other daily tools and clothing. based on their inputs, we built a sensor system for monitoring physical activity. the system automatically and wirelessly reports the accumulated number of steps taken, using a mobile phone as the patient terminal. we asked 1001 persons about their use of step counters/pedometers. about 6.5% of them use such a device daily and about 20% daily, weekly or monthly. our concept differs from others of this nature in its simplicity, size and integration with other relevant patient data. it is fully manageable by patients themselves as a self-help tool.$1

743$process mining; supervised abstraction; event log; alignment;from low-level events to activities - a pattern-based approach;process mining techniques analyze processes based on event data. a crucial assumption for process analysis is that events correspond to occurrences of meaningful activities. often, low-level events recorded by information systems do not directly correspond to these. abstraction methods, which provide a mapping from the recorded events to activities recognizable by process workers, are needed. existing supervised abstraction methods require a full model of the entire process as input and cannot handle noise. this paper proposes a supervised abstraction method based on behavioral activity patterns that capture domain knowledge on the relation between activities and events. through an alignment between the activity patterns and the low-level event logs an abstracted event log is obtained. events in the abstracted event log correspond to instantiations of recognizable activities. the method is evaluated with domain experts of a norwegian hospital using an event log from their digital whiteboard system. the evaluation shows that state-of-the art process mining methods provide valuable insights on the usage of the system when using the abstracted event log, but fail when using the original lower level event log.$0
